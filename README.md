This code is released under the "Don't Plagiarize" license. In other words, you can do whatever with the code except for plagiarize. By plagiarism, I follow the [GWU code of Academic Integrity](http://www.gwu.edu/~ntegrity/code.html#definition) by defining it as "intentionally representing the words, ideas, or sequence of ideas of another as one's own in any academic exercise; failure to attribute any of the following: quotations, paraphrases, or borrowed information."
